HortiPlanner: Your Backyard Gardening Companion
As a student passionate about applying core programming skills to solve real-world problems, I developed this console-based application to help homestead gardeners and urban farming enthusiasts plan their green space effectively.
This project was developed entirely using the C programming language. My focus was on creating a lightweight, fast, and resource-efficient tool by leveraging fundamental programming principles, memory management, and logical problem-solving in C.

Key Features:

Custom Garden Sizing: Users can input the precise length and width of their garden plot.

Crop Selection: Choose from a variety of common vegetables like tomatoes, lettuce, carrots, and more.

Optimal Plant Calculation: The application instantly calculates the maximum number of plants that can fit in the given area based on scientifically recommended spacing for healthy growth.

Visual Layout: It generates a simple text-based visualizer in the console, showing a grid-like plan of where to place each plant for optimal spacing.

The goal of HortiPlanner is to take the guesswork out of gardening. It empowers users to:

Maximize their available space for better yields.

Prevent plant overcrowding, leading to healthier crops.

Make gardening more accessible and systematic for beginners.

Promote sustainable and efficient urban farming practices.

This project was a fantastic challenge and a great way to strengthen my C programming skills. I'm always open to feedback and suggestions!
